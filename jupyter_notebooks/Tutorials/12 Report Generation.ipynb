    "# Report Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi is able to construct polished report documents, which provide high-level summaries as well as detailed analyses  of GST results.  Reports are intended to be quick and easy way of analyzing a GST estimate, and pyGSTi's report generation functions are specifically designed to interact with its high-level driver functions (see the high-level algorithms tutorial).  Currently there is only a single report generation function, `pygsti.report.create_general_report`, which takes one or more `Results` objects as input and produces an HTML file as output.  The HTML format allows the reports to include **interactive plots** and **switches**, making it easy to compare different types of analysis or data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi's \"general\" report creates a stand-alone HTML document which cannot run Python.  Thus, all the results displayed in the report must be pre-computed (in Python).  If you find yourself wanting to fiddle with things and feel that the general report is too static, please consider using a `Workspace` object (see following tutorials) within a Jupyter notebook, where you can intermix report tables/plots and Python.  Internally, `create_general_report` is just a canned routine which uses a `WorkSpace` object to generate various tables and plots and then inserts them into a HTML template.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note to veteran users:** PyGSTi has recently transitioned to producing HTML (rather than LaTeX/PDF) reports.  The way to generate such report is largely unchanged, with one important exception.  Previously, the `Results` object had various report-generation methods included within it.  We've found this is too restrictive, as we'd sometimes like to generate a report which utilizes the results from multiple runs of GST (to compare the, for instance).  Thus, the `Results` class is now just a container for a `DataSet` and its related `GateSet`s, `GatestringStructure`s, etc.  All of the report-generation capability is now housed in within separate report functions, which we now demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get some `Results`\n",
    "We start by performing GST using `do_long_sequence_gst`, as usual, to create a `Results` object (we could also have just loaded one from file)."
