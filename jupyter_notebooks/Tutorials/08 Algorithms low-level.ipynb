    "# Algorithms: low-level interface\n",
    "Once we have data for GST, there are several *algorithms* we can run on it to produce tomographic estimates. Depending on the amount of data you have, and time available for running Gate Set Tomography, one algorithm may be preferable over the others.  **What is typically thought of as \"standard GST\" is the iterative maximum-likelihood optimization implemented by `do_iterative_mlgst`** which uses a combination of minimum-$\\chi^2$ GST and maximum-likelihood GST.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pygsti` provides support for the following GST algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Gate Set Tomography (LGST)**: Uses short gate sequences to quickly compute a rough (low accuracy) estimate of a gate set by linear inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extended Linear Gate Set Tomography (eLGST or EXLGST)**: Minimizes the sub-of-squared errors between independent LGST estimates and the estimates obtained from a single gate set to find a best-estimate gate set.  This is typically done in an interative fashion, using LGST estimates for longer and longer sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimum-$\\chi^2$ Gate Set Tomography (MC2GST)**: Minimizes the $\\chi^{2}$ statistic of the data frequencies and gate set probabilities to find a best-estimate gate set.  Typically done in an interative fashion, using successively larger sets of longer and longer gate sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maximum-Likelihood Gate Set Tomography (MLGST)**: Maximizes the log-likelihood statistic of the data frequencies and gate set probabilities to find a best-estimate gate set.  Typically done in an interative fashion similar to MC2GST.  This maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is very well-motivated from a statistics standpoint and should be the **most accurate among the algorithms**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, the implementation of the algorithms for LGST, EXLGST, MC2GST, and MLGST may be found in the `pygsti.algorithms.core` module.  In this tutorial, we'll show how to invoke each of these algorithms."

    "- a `DataSet` containing the data that GST attempts to fit using the probabilities generated by a single `GateSet`.  This data set must at least contain the data for the gate sequences required by the algorithm that is chosen.\n",
    "- for EXLGST, MC2GST, and MLGST, a list-of-lists of `GateString` objects, which specify which gate strings are used during each iteration of the algorithm (the length of the top-level list defines the number of interations).  Note that which gate strings are included in these lists is different for EXLGST than it is for MC2GST and MLGST."

Which is good - it means GST is giving us estimates which are close to the _true_ gateset used to generate the data.
